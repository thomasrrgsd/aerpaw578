# Developement and Testbed Runs
## Organization

- Each run should have a unique number.
- Each unique run number should be appended with "d" for developement run. Or "t" for testbed run.
- The folder should contain a text file with comments on what is unique about the run. For example, changing a specific setting.
- The folder will contain a set of text file logs with the date and type indicated.
- Each text file will have a comma seperated value (csv) equivalent.
- Every csv file will be merged into one csv file that is the name of the run. Same as the folder.
- Each run should have the associated vehicle parameter file in it from the oeo console.
