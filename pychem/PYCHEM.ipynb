    "# CHEM INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is CHEM and PyCHEM\n",
    "\n",
    "CHEM stands for channel emulator. We've modified the hardware drivers to communicate over network to transfer signals instead of through hardware. Channel Emulator takes the raw I/Q samples and applies channels effects(Path Loss, Ch. Coeffs., etc.). Channel Emulator runs inside the CHEM-VM which experimenters don't have access to it. To configure CHEM for different scenarios, it needs to be controlled with pyCHEM. pyCHEM is a python library for communicating with CHEM remotely. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How To Connect CHEM with pyCHEM\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2 options,\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Jupyter Notebook__\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Jupyter notebook is python notebook interface which allows live coding in Python. It runs as a server and user can connect to it with the web interface Jupyter provides. User will be able to execute code inside the OEO-CONSOLE without trying to run it over command line. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    To connect,\n",
    "    * ssh to OEO-CONSOLE with port forwarding to 8888 \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "     ~ ssh -L localhost:8888:localhost:8888 root@<oeo-console-ip-address>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * After establishing ssh connection to OEO-Console, go to the directory you want to work on(for saving your project files)\n",
    "    * Jupyter notebook should be started with the command below\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "     ~ python3 -m notebook\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * Previous command will start the Jupyter notebook web server and provide link similar to output below,\n",
    "    <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "        To access the notebook, open this file in a browser:<br>                \n",
    "        <a href=\"\">http://localhost:8888/?token=2d4e9f5b1ea0fa4031fe4bd287303db89400942f1d714cd4</a> <br>\n",

    "    </div>\n",
    "    <br>\n",
    "    * After opening the localhost link that is provided in the command line, you will be able to use PyCHEM\n",
    "* __Python Shell__\n",
    "\n",
    "    Python shell is much easier to access but it might be hard to use in the long term. You will be using command line interface of Python. User should keep this in mind that nothing is saved on Python shell. It mostly useful quick tests.\n",
    "    * User can connect OEO-CONSOLE without port forwarding such as below \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "     ~ ssh root@<oeo-console-ip-address>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    * After establishing ssh connection, you just need to run the command below,\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "     ~ python3 \n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
